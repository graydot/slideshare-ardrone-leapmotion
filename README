About this repo
===============

Slideshare October Hackday was fun. This repo contains the code for the hack which involves
1. Controlling a drone using a leapmotion device
2. Obtaining the video feed, extracting frames and uploading the slideshow (made with those images) to Slideshare
3. Slideshare uses Cruisecontrol. This part of the hack involved getting the drone to fetch the build status from ccrb, and hovering with flashing lights when the build failed.
